# TTGO-I2C-Scanner
Little I2C Scanner with TTGO Display

A little I2C-Scanner made with TTGO-Display, it diasplays every I2C-Adress found. Multiple Sensors and other thing can have more than one adress, it displays every of their adresses.

I added some Names for known standard-adresses. You can edit the list into the code and add more names, attention to the length of the names. They must fit into one line, too long names will be cutted and not fully visible.

You can change the Code and share it.

I soldered a little silvern 500mAh Lipo to the connector. Its enough for many many tests. A little standardswitch breaks the voltage. If its switched on it will display the I2C adresses.

The SDA is soldered to Pin 21.
SCL is soldered to Pin 22.

I soldered a wired connector to pin 3V3 and 5V and GND.
GND is soldered to GND.

I use a 6x screwterminal to them and use 5 connectors of it. Obe ot them is not connected.

Usage:
Connect your Sensor / Breakoutboard / Device to it and switch on. It displays the adresses.
Its a good idea to make some wired connectors for different things, maybe a adaptercable for StemmaQT-Connectors.

As a case for it you can use nearly every TTGO-Case thats found in many many variant at Printables, Maker, Cults3d... use what you want. I cant share my case because i edited it and sharing and mixing is not allowed for it.
